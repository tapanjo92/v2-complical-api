# Claude Session Summary - July 2, 2025

## Session Overview
**Date**: July 2, 2025  
**Project**: CompliCal API - Compliance Deadline Tracking System  
**Main Achievement**: Successfully deployed to us-east-1 with Kinesis-based usage metering

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Multi-Region Deployment Preparation
- Updated all hardcoded `ap-south-1` references to be configurable
- Made region selection dynamic across:
  - Shell scripts
  - AWS SDK clients
  - CDK configuration
  - Frontend API endpoints

### 2. Domain Migration
- Updated all references from `complical.ai` to `getcomplical.com`
- Updated email service configurations
- Prepared for DNS configuration

### 3. Kinesis as Primary Metric Counter
- Confirmed Kinesis Analytics is enabled (`ENABLE_KINESIS_ANALYTICS=true`)
- Verified real-time usage tracking architecture
- Created comprehensive documentation: `KINESIS_USAGE_METERING.md`

### 4. Full Production Deployment to us-east-1

#### Infrastructure Deployed:
- ✅ DynamoDB Tables (6 tables)
- ✅ Cognito Authentication
- ✅ Kinesis Data Streams + Analytics
- ✅ API Gateway: `https://5jhvtpw59k.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/`
- ✅ CloudFront: `https://d1w7a2rnrej1jo.cloudfront.net`
- ✅ WAF Protection
- ✅ CloudWatch Monitoring

#### Data Loaded:
- 11 compliance deadlines (8 AU, 3 NZ)
- 6 agencies: ATO, ASIC, Revenue NSW, SRO VIC, IRD, ACC

### 5. Deployment Script Organization

Created structured deployment scripts:
```
deployment/scripts/
├── README.md
├── us-east-1/
│   ├── deploy-backend.sh
│   ├── deploy-frontend.sh
│   └── verify-deployment.sh
├── ap-south-1/
│   ├── deploy-backend.sh
│   ├── deploy-frontend.sh
│   └── verify-deployment.sh
└── post-deployment/
    ├── update-frontend-csp.sh
    └── test-api-usage.sh
```

### 6. Streamlined Documentation
- Removed 7 redundant scripts
- Consolidated deployment docs into `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Kept technical Kinesis documentation

### 7. Post-Deployment Issues Resolved

#### CSP Issue:
- **Problem**: Frontend CSP was blocking API calls to us-east-1
- **Solution**: Updated CSP to dynamically include deployed API URL
- **Script**: `deployment/scripts/post-deployment/update-frontend-csp.sh`

#### Security Headers:
- Current grade: **A** (SecurityHeaders.com)
- Added missing headers for better security
- Documented path to A+ grade

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Migration Resource
- **Decision**: Keep the `UsageMigrationResource` as-is
- **Reason**: Harmless operation that ensures all API keys have billing fields
- **Impact**: Adds ~2 seconds to deployment, ensures data consistency

### 2. Kinesis Configuration
- **Primary metric counter**: Kinesis Data Streams
- **Benefits**: Real-time, cost-effective (~$90/month for 10M calls)
- **Features**: 7-day replay, sub-second latency, fair billing (only 2xx counts)

### 3. Region Defaults
- Changed from `ap-south-1` to `us-east-1` as default
- Made all scripts region-agnostic with environment variables

## Environment Configuration

### Key Files Created:
1. `.env.us-east-1` - Environment variables for us-east-1
2. `frontend/.env.production` - Frontend production config
3. `deploy-us-east-1.sh` - Automated deployment script

### Important URLs:
- **API**: https://5jhvtpw59k.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
- **Frontend**: https://d1w7a2rnrej1jo.cloudfront.net
- **Kinesis Dashboard**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards:name=complical-usage-analytics-prod

## Next Steps

1. **DNS Configuration**: Point `getcomplical.com` to CloudFront
2. **SES Setup**: Verify domain for email sending
3. **API Key Creation**: Generate first API keys via frontend
4. **Security Enhancement**: Plan refactoring for A+ security grade

## Commands Reference

### Deploy to us-east-1:
```bash
cd deployment/scripts/us-east-1
./deploy-backend.sh prod true
./deploy-frontend.sh prod
./verify-deployment.sh prod
```

### Fix CSP Issues:
```bash
cd deployment/scripts/post-deployment
./update-frontend-csp.sh prod us-east-1
```

### Test API Usage:
```bash
cd deployment/scripts/post-deployment
./test-api-usage.sh prod YOUR_API_KEY us-east-1
```

### Load Data:
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 TABLE_NAME=complical-deadlines-prod node scripts/load-data.js
```
