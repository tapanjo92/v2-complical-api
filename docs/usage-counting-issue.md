# Critical Usage Counting Issue

## Problem Summary
The usage counting system has severe accuracy issues:

1. **prod-key-1**: Made 5 calls, initially showed 0, now shows 2
2. **prod-key-2**: Made 10 calls, shows 20 (double counting!)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Cache was removed but problem persists
- Removed 5-minute API Gateway cache (set to 0)
- Lambda increased to 512MB for faster execution
- Updates ARE synchronous with await

### Issue 2: Wrong counting
The counts are completely wrong, suggesting:
1. Race conditions in DynamoDB updates
2. Multiple Lambda invocations updating the same counter
3. Possible issue with the update expression

### Issue 3: Production-Grade Requirements Not Met
- Counts MUST be accurate for billing
- Real-time updates MUST work
- No delays or eventual consistency issues allowed

## Next Steps
Need to implement a truly production-grade solution:
1. Use DynamoDB conditional updates with proper error handling
2. Consider using atomic counters or transactions
3. Add proper logging to trace every update
4. Implement idempotency to prevent double counting
