# ðŸŽ‰ Kinesis Real-Time Analytics Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status: âœ… COMPLETE

Your Kinesis Data Streams real-time analytics solution has been successfully deployed!

## What Was Deployed

### 1. **Kinesis Data Stream** âœ…
- Stream Name: `complical-usage-stream-test`
- Capacity: 2 shards (2,000 records/sec, 4 MB/sec)
- Retention: 7 days
- Status: ACTIVE

### 2. **Stream Processor Lambda** âœ…
- Function: `CompliCal-Kinesis-test-StreamProcessorA985C501-ENmC8bZFHszT`
- Event Source Mapping: ENABLED
- Batch Size: 100 records
- Parallelization Factor: 10

### 3. **Analytics DynamoDB Table** âœ…
- Table Name: `complical-analytics-test`
- Billing Mode: Pay-per-request
- Indexes: time-index GSI for time-based queries

### 4. **Real-time Aggregator** âœ…
- Runs every minute
- Aggregates data for dashboards

### 5. **CloudWatch Dashboard** âœ…
- URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-south-1#dashboards:name=complical-usage-analytics-test
- Real-time metrics and graphs

### 6. **API Gateway Authorizer** âœ…
- Updated to Kinesis-enabled version
- Handler: `handlers/auth/api-key-authorizer-kinesis.handler`
- Sends events to Kinesis stream

## How It Works

1. **API Call Made** â†’ API Gateway receives request
2. **Authorizer Validates** â†’ Kinesis authorizer checks API key
3. **Event Sent to Kinesis** â†’ Usage event streamed in real-time
4. **Stream Processor** â†’ Lambda processes batches of events
5. **Analytics Table** â†’ Events stored for analysis
6. **Real-time Aggregator** â†’ Updates dashboards every minute
7. **CloudWatch Dashboard** â†’ View real-time metrics

## Testing the System

To test with a valid API key from tapmit200@gmail.com:

```bash
# The API key starts with: EI6LVo8F
# Use the full API key in the x-api-key header

curl -X GET "https://vmvjp2v1fl.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/v1/deadlines?country=US" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_FULL_API_KEY"
```

## Monitoring

1. **CloudWatch Dashboard**: View real-time metrics
2. **Kinesis Metrics**: Monitor stream performance
3. **Lambda Logs**: Check processing logs

## Cost Estimate

- **Base Cost**: ~$100/month for 2 shards
- **Scales with**: API call volume
- **Cost Optimization**: Consider on-demand mode for variable traffic

## What's Next?

1. **Make API Calls**: The system is ready to track usage
2. **Monitor Dashboard**: Watch real-time analytics appear
3. **Check Analytics API**: Query usage data programmatically
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure CloudWatch alarms for anomalies

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see data immediately:
1. Ensure you're using a valid API key
2. Check authorizer logs: `/aws/lambda/CompliCal-API-test-ApiKeyAuthorizerFunction*`
3. Check stream processor logs: `/aws/lambda/CompliCal-Kinesis-test-StreamProcessor*`
4. Verify Kinesis metrics in CloudWatch

## Support

The system is fully deployed and operational. Real-time tracking will begin as soon as API calls are made with valid API keys.
